# Background
The intention of this project is to use computer vision to understand the implications of the geometric orientation of objects in the real world.  This can be critically important for machine decisions regarding safety and understanding of the environment.  By enabling and deploying such decision making at the edge, IoT devices can more rapidly solve life threatening events.  Traditional computer vision libraries are excellent at identifying and segmenting a number of static classified objects from a scene, and the goal of this project is to further understand the segmented object.  Whether specific changes of the segmented object's orientation can be ascertained, and to understand if it will interpolate previously untrained angles from new data.

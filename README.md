# Objective
Using synthetically trained computer vision to detect changes in the set angle of a device.

# 3 Easy Steps

## 1 Generate Synthetic Dataset
### See Notebook on Blender Model Generation
##### You need to run the py file for your model inside of blender's "Scripting" tab.  This is the .txt document under "notebooks"

## 2 Train Models
### See Elevation and Azimuth Model Training Notebook
##### Special Note: I have a few dozen notebooks.  I only uploaded a few to show concept of how I trained data.

## Deploy
### Run Live Inference.  200x200 Arrays are what I used (Recommend 224x224 for future developers as this is the imagenet default)
